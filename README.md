Comprehensive OSINT Toolbox

**OSINT Box** is an open-source collection of OSINT (Open Source Intelligence) tools and resources, organized by country.

## Project Goals
- Collect and categorize OSINT tools for different countries.
- Provide a resource for people working in security, journalism, research, and law enforcement.

## Project Structure
- `/countries/`: Contains markdown files for each country with a list of tools and resources specific to that country.
- `/tools/`: Contains markdown files categorizing general OSINT tools (e.g., web scraping, social media analysis, public records, etc.).
